# Caliber Trainer Report Backend
## Description: 
Excaliber is a web application used to display trainer batch information in visually appealing charts. It is designed to take in a JSON file filled with a Trainerâ€™s information and specific Batches data. It also has been refactored to take data from external api endpoints from a specified list of trainers.

### 9/22/2020: 
Batch 821 was assigned a job in order to refactor a legacy application. Our specific objectives were listed below
# BATCH 821 User Stories
- I should be able to pull report data directly from caliber if I do not wish to provide a JSON file with the appropriate data. (Completed)

- Change the default view for the line graph I see should include all possible options displayed at once. (Completed)
- Refactor frontend chart naming scheme (Completed)
- Print to PDF functionality (Completed)
- Deploy on Revature provided EC2 with CI/CD (In progress)
